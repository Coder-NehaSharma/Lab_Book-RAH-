Welcome to the **RoboAI Manual**, a futuristic, interactive digital guidebook designed to teach robotics, electronics, and coding concepts to students and hobbyists. Unlike traditional static manuals, this project features a **Cyberpunk/HUD-style interface** with **real-time simulations** that allow users to experiment with components directly in the browser.

## 📚 Curriculum Overview

The manual covers a complete beginner-to-intermediate robotics journey:
1.  **Introduction:** What is a robot?
2.  **Electronics:** Components (Resistors, Capacitors), Ohm's Law (Calculator included).
3.  **Arduino UNO:** Board layout, pins, and first sketch.
4.  **Sensors:** Ultrasonic, IR, PIR, and more.
5.  **Actuators:** Motors, Servos, and Drivers (L293D/L298N).
6.  **Coding Basics:** Variables, Loops, Functions, and Logic.
7.  **Projects:** Line Follower, Obstacle Avoider, and Innovation Challenges.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** Custom properties (Variables), Flexbox/Grid, and Animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Logic for all calculators, simulations, and drag-and-drop activities.
- **Electron:** (Optional) Wrapped as a desktop application.
