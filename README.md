Welcome to the **RoboAI Manual**, a futuristic, interactive digital guidebook designed to teach robotics, electronics, and coding concepts to students and hobbyists. Unlike traditional static manuals, this project features a **Cyberpunk/HUD-style interface** with **real-time simulations** that allow users to experiment with components directly in the browser.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎮 Interactive Simulations
Don't just read about it—try it!
- **🦇 Ultrasonic Radar:** A functional radar simulation that detects objects and warns the user based on proximity logic.
- **🦾 Virtual Servo Arm:** Control a robotic arm with a slider and see the corresponding Arduino code generate in real-time.
- **⚡ Resistor Color Code Solver:** Select bands to dynamically calculate resistance and see the resistor change colors.
- **💡 Logic Gate Playground:** Toggle inputs for AND, OR, NOT, XOR gates and watch the logic bulb light up.
- **🧩 Drag & Drop Coding:** Learn C++ syntax by fixing "broken" code blocks for Loops, Conditionals, and Functions.

### 🎨 Robotic Theme
- **Dark Mode UI:** Sleek, high-contrast dark theme with neon accents (Cyan/Yellow).
- **HUD Elements:** Futuristic fonts (*Orbitron*, *Share Tech Mono*) and data visualization components.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
